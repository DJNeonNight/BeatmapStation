# BeatmapStation
BeatmapStation is a tool which downloads beatmaps from osu! by searching for them, by replays, or even by messages sent to the user in-game. More information can be found at the original thread on the official osu! forum: https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/727561

For the moment, this is going to stay just as a simple repository to make the translation easier for those who want to contribute to this matter. Also, it'll be used to track issues on the app.
